# Wait for Me

Enter the `wait-for-me/support/` folder and go through the practice items below.

1. Run the code in `wait_for_me_processes.py`.
    The parent process creates one child that writes and message to the given file.
    Then the parent reads that message.
    Simple enough, right?
    But running the code raises a `FileNotFoundError`.
    If you inspect the file you gave the script as an argument, it does contain a string.
    What's going on?

    In order to solve race conditions, we need **synchronization**.
    This is a mechanism similar to a set of traffic lights in a crossroads.
    Just like traffic lights allow some cars to pass only after others have already passed, synchronization is a means for threads to communicate with each other and tell each other to access a resource or not.

    The most basic form of synchronization is **waiting**.
    Concretely, if the parent process **waits** for the child to end, we are sure the file is created and its contents are written.

1. Use `join()` to make the parent wait for its child before reading the file.
